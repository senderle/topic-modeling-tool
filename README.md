### Topic Modeling Tool
###### A GUI for MALLET's implementation of LDA.

--
#### New features:

* **Metadata integration**
* **Customizable CSV delimiters**
* **Alpha/Beta optimization**
* **Custom regex tokenizer**
* **Parallel processor support**

Some of these sound impressive, but are really just taking advantage of the impressive features that MALLET already provides! 

Individual file (a.k.a. CSV) input is still disabled, but most things work smoothly if the input is well-formed. If something bugs you, feel free to submit an issue.
