### Topic Modeling Tool
###### A GUI for MALLET's implementation of LDA.<sup>*</sup>

--
#### New features:

* **Metadata integration**
* **Customizable CSV delimiters**
* **Alpha/Beta optimization**
* **Custom regex tokenizer**
* **Multiprocessing support**

A number of these simply provide access to features that MALLET already provides. 

Individual file (a.k.a. CSV) input is still disabled, but most things work smoothly if the input is well-formed. If something bugs you, feel free to submit an issue.
