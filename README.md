# Topic Modeling Tool

### A GUI for MALLET's implementation of LDA.

#### New features:

* **Metadata integration**
* **Custom CSV delimiters**
* **Alpha/Beta optimization**
* **Custom regex tokenization**
* **Multicore processor support**

### Getting started:

To start using some of these new features right away, consult the 
[quickstart guide](https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html).

#### Requirements:

You'll need to have a fairly recent version of Java; the version that came
with your computer may not work, especially if your computer is a Mac.

If you have a newer Mac, you probably don't have Java installed at all. 
Whatever your operating system, you can install an updated version of Java, 
by following the instructions for your operating system 
[here](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml).

This version of the tool was forked from the [original version](http://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool) by [David Newman](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/) and [Arun Balagopalan](https://github.com/arunbg).

Previous work on the GUI for MALLET has been supported by a National Leadership Grant (LG-06-08-0057-08) from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to Yale University, the University of Michigan, and the University of California, Irvine. The Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation's 123,000 libraries and 17,500 museums. The Institute's mission is to create strong libraries and museums that connect people to information and ideas.

Work on this version of the tool has benefited from the support of [Penn Libraries](http://www.library.upenn.edu/) and the the University of Pennsylvania's [Price Lab for Digital Humanities](https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/).
